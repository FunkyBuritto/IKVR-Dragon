<h1><samp>How To Fly</samp></h1>

<h3><samp>Calibration</samp></h3>
When you open the game you start in a main menu, it's <b>important</b> that you go through the calibration first. The calibration itself is very simple, you just need to do a "lose t-pose" for 1 second.

<h3><samp>Levels</samp></h3>
Once the calibration is done you can chose the level that you want to fly in. The high quality level is a poorly optimized level so i can only recomended playing this level with a high-end pc. The low Quality level is a lot easyer to run and it still gives the full flying experience.

<h3><samp>Gliding</samp></h3>
You glide by stretching both your arms out and making a "t-pose". If your arms are more straight the glide will be more effective. The most effective glide will barely make you move down and slowly add speed forwards. 

<h3><samp>Wing Flap</samp></h3>
You flap your wings by making a flapping motion, this motion is pretty big and requires a bit of real world effort to complete succesfully multiple times. If you flap your wings to fast the flap will be less effective, but if its to slow the flap won't happen.

*Note: You always move towards where you look, this also works verticaly so be sure to look up if you want to gain vertical height quicker*
